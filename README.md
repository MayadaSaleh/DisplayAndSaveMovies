# DisplayAndSaveMovies
Android Project by Java Language that display Movies Name and Posters Orderd by Movie Name.
* First time, user name is saved to shared preference then we display movies name and posters-using Glid library- in Recycler view From Webservice API.
* Second Time, we fetch user name from shared preference and App is opened to the recycler view and this time we fetch data from sqlite not Webservice.
